This repo also contains a number of experiments, micro benchmarks, and code generation that led to [the final version](https://github.com/kevin-montrose/OptimizationExercise.SIMDRespParsing/blob/main/OptimizationExercise.SIMDRespParsing/RespParserFinal.cs).
Most of it is pointless, but preserved for future reference.
